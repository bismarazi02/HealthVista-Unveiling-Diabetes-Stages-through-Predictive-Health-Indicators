# HealthVista-Unveiling-Diabetes-Stages-through-Predictive-Health-Indicators
One of the most prevalent diseases in the world, diabetes, when detected early, may prevent the
progression of the disease and avoid other complications. In clinical analysis, logistic regression
is a popular machine learning classification model. In order to better understand the relationship
between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables, it makes use of
probabilistic estimations. In this work, a prediction model will be developed that use specific
diagnostic measurements from the dataset, predicts the stages of diabetes whether a patient has
diabetes, pre-diabetes or no diabetes and various techniques will be explored to boost the
performance and accuracy. In methodology the dataset for this work is collected from Kaggle.
Logistic Regression is the main algorithm used in this work and for analysis Python IDE is used.
